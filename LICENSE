# Crowd-Density-Estimation

A comprehensive solution for crowd density estimation using U-Net-based segmentation. This project combines custom-built components for data processing, model training, and visualization to accurately estimate crowd density in images.

## Features
- **U-Net Architecture**: Utilizes a custom implementation of the U-Net architecture for semantic segmentation.
- **Modular Codebase**: Includes reusable components for data handling, training, visualization, and utility functions.
- **Custom Dataset Support**: Supports loading and processing custom datasets for training and evaluation.
- **Visualization Tools**: Built-in visualization functions to analyze model predictions and results.
